12.22.15

Activated The Grid.

Created four initial sites: shinyab, shinya, theta360, mephoto.

Added few theta photos to shinyab

I also activated THETA In-Camera HDR feature //  

And my facebook post...

RICOH THETA in general (english version)
  
I am working so hard right now to finish my RICOH THETA book, and these updates happen... Well, Happy New Year, New Ricoh Theta.. now you are really new! 

RICOH THETA S 1.3.0 (In-camera HDR feature)
https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/ricoh-theta-s/id1023254741?mt=8 

THETA+ 1.1.0 (New cropping tool and filters)
https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/theta+/id1021526610?mt=8 

THETA+ Video 1.0.1   
https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/theta+-video/id1053796512?mt=8 

HDR for Ricoh Theta S (Bracket Shooting App) 
https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/hdr-for-ricoh-theta-s/id1068236717?mt=8 

Note: In order to use in-camera HDR feature, you need to update your camera's firmware. You would need PC app to do so. When you try this, Adobe AIR Updater might ask you to update your AIR to 20.0. However, 20.0.0.204 runtime might not be compatible with your Mac app (it did not work on mine --- OS 10.10.5). If your RICOH THETA app stop working after Adobe AIR update, I suggest uninstall 'Adobe AIR 20 runtime' by using 'Adobe AIR Uninstaller' (this app is in your Utility folder), then re-install 19\. You can download 'Adobe AIR 19 runtime' from Adobe archive, https://helpx.adobe.com/air/kb/archived-air-sdk-version.html // When this happens you probably also need to re-install your RICOH THETA app... And Adobe AIR will ask you again to update your AIR 19 to 20, now you know what not to do.. so, please be careful.
